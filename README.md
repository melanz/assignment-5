cs558-assignment-5
==================
For this assignment, you should create a module that involves processing meshes or triangulations.  Follow the same instructions as before.

# Projects

### [`incremental-delaunay`](https://github.com/mikolalysenko/incremental-delaunay)

Incremental delaunay triangulation by edge flipping

Author: Mikola Lysenko


### [`delaunay-triangulate`](https://github.com/mikolalysenko/delaunay-triangulate)

Computes a Delaunay triangulation for a collection of points

Author: Mikola Lysenko

### [`voronoi-diagram`](https://github.com/mikolalysenko/voronoi-diagram)

Constructs a Voronoi diagram for a collection of points

Author: Mikola Lysenko

### [`half-edge-3d`](https://github.com/melanz/half-edge-3d)

The half-edge data structure. This data structure provides efficient manipulation of the topological information associated with the objects in question (vertices, edges, faces).

Author: Daniel Melanz

# Ideas

* Half edge data structure
* Point location in planar triangulation by jump and walk
* Point location with independent set data structures
* Convex hull in 3D and higher (can be done using delaunay triangulation or by porting O'Rourke)
